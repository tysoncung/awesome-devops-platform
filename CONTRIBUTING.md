# Contributing to Awesome DevOps Platform Engineering

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this curated list! This resource aims to help the platform engineering community discover the best tools, practices, and resources.

## Guidelines

### What We're Looking For

We welcome contributions that:
- Focus on **platform engineering**, internal developer platforms, or developer experience
- Are **actively maintained** (commits within the last 6 months for tools, recent updates for content)
- Have **clear documentation** and getting started guides
- Provide **unique value** to platform engineers and DevOps teams
- Follow **cloud-native** and **GitOps** principles where applicable

### Quality Standards

- **Tools**: Must have clear use cases, documentation, and community/commercial support
- **Resources**: Should be comprehensive, well-written, and regularly updated
- **Learning Materials**: Must be high-quality, accurate, and relevant to modern practices
- **Commercial Tools**: Are welcome if they provide significant value (not just advertisements)

### Submission Format

Please ensure your submission follows this format:

```markdown
- [Tool/Resource Name](URL) - Brief, clear description ending with a period.
```

Examples:
- ‚úÖ `- [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) - Open platform for building developer portals, created by Spotify.`
- ‚ùå `- [Tool](URL) - Amazing tool!!!` (avoid marketing language)
- ‚ùå `- [Tool](URL) - A tool` (too vague)

### How to Contribute

5. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title: `Add [Tool/Resource Name] to [Section]`

### What We Don't Accept

- Abandoned or deprecated projects
- Tools with poor documentation
- Duplicate entries or very similar tools without clear differentiation

### Updating Existing Entries

If you notice:
- **Broken links**: Please submit a PR to remove or update them
- **Outdated information**: Update the description or suggest removal if deprecated

### Creating New Categories

If you believe a new category is needed:
1. Ensure it's not already covered by existing sections
2. Propose at least 5 quality entries for the new category
3. Explain why this category is essential for platform engineers

## Review Process

Pull requests will be reviewed based on:
1. **Relevance** to platform engineering and DevOps
2. **Quality** of the tool/resource
3. **Uniqueness** of the contribution
4. **Compliance** with formatting guidelines
5. **Community value** and potential impact
